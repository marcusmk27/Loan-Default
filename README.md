# Loan-Default-Predictor

## Overview

We were tasked with building a loan default predictor model based on various borrower attributes and historical loan data.The objective of this project was to create a machine learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to default on their loans, based on their loan repayment behaviour and ecommerce transaction activity.To achieve this, we adopted a data-driven approach and employed powerful tools such as Power BI, Python, and PostgreSQL.

## Technology Used

<li> Python </li>
<li> PowerBi </li>
<li> PostgreSQL </li>
<li> Tableau </li>
<li> Streamlit </li>

Installation
To run the project successfully, we ensured that we have the following dependencies installed:

<li> Python </li>
<li> NumPy </li>
<li> Pandas </li>
<li> Scikit-learn </li>
<li> Matplotlib </li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook </li>

### Visualisations

To represent the data,uncover patterns or trend, and checking for the linear relationship, We used the following

<li> Tables </li>
<li> Charts and Graphs </li>
<li> Heatmaps </li>


## Model Deployment

We explored several machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. After thorough evaluation, we selected the best-performing model which is decision tree based on various evaluation metrics, ensuring its reliability and accuracy.    

## User Interface: 

We used Streamlit which allows us to design a simple and intuitive user interface for the web app. We can created input elements such as text boxes to capture the borrower's attributes needed for prediction.

## Project status 
In Progress
